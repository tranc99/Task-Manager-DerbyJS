# racer-highway
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/racer-highway.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/racer-highway/)

Transport plugin for [Racer](https://github.com/codeparty/racer). It uses pure `websockets` and fallbacks to `browserchannel` in the case of old browsers and proxy errors. If you only need to use `websockets` try [racer-ws](https://github.com/derbyparty/racer-ws).

## Usage

In the server part of your app:

```js
var highway = require('racer-highway'); 

// ...
// var server = http.createServer
// ...

// ...
// var store  = racer.createStore 
// or
// var store  = derby.createStore
// ...

var handlers = highway(store);

expressApp = express();

// ...

expressApp.use(cookieParser());
expressApp.use(session());

// ...

expressApp.use(handlers.middleware);


server.on('upgrade', handlers.upgrade);
```

Connect session support in hooks:
```
var serverOptions = {
  session: session()
}
var handlers = racerHighWay(store, serverOptions);
```
