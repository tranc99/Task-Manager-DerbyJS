Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications.\n\nDerby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline.\n\nSee docs here: **http://derbyjs.com/**\n\nExamples here: **https://github.com/codeparty/derby-examples**\n\n## Major updates coming soon!\n\n0.6 was a complete rewrite that funadamentally changed a lot of things internally. 0.6 increases performance, reduces memory leaks, and improves stability. The docs are still being updated. There have been many API changes, but they are straightforward for current Derby apps. Most of the changes are simplifications that will clean up awkward limitiations of the previous version.\n\nIf you have feedback, ideas, or suggestions, please message the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/derbyjs) or create an Issue.
